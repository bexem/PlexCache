# PlexCache: Automate Plex Media Management

Automate Plex media management: Efficiently transfer media from the On Deck/Watchlist to the cache, and seamlessly move watched media back to their respective locations.

## Overview

PlexCache efficiently transfers media from the On Deck/Watchlist to the cache and moves watched media back to their respective locations. This Python script reduces energy consumption by minimizing the need to spin up the array/hard drive(s) when watching recurrent media like TV series. It achieves this by moving the media from the OnDeck and watchlist for the main user and/or other users. For TV shows/anime, it also fetches the next specified number of episodes.

## Features

- Fetch a specified number of episodes from the "onDeck" for the main user and other users.
- Skip fetching onDeck media for specified users.
- Fetch a specified number of episodes from the "watchlist" for the main user and other users.
- Skip fetching watchlist media for specified users.
- Search only the specified libraries.
- Check for free space before moving any file.
- Move watched media present on the cache drive back to the array.
- Move relative subtitles along with the media moved to or from the cache.
- Filter media older than a specified number of days.
- Run in debug mode for testing.
- Use of a log file for easy debugging.
- Use caching system to avoid wastful memory usage and cpu cycles.
- Use of multitasking to optimize file transfer time.
- Exit the script if any active session or skip the currently playing media.
- Find your missing unicorn.

**Work in progress (pre-releases)**

- Use symbolic links if the script is not running on UNRAID. **(UNTESTED)**

## Setup

Please check out our [Wiki section](https://github.com/bexem/PlexCache/wiki) for the step-by-step guide on how to setup PlexCache on your system. 

## Notes

This script should be compatible with other systems, especially Linux-based ones, although I have primarily tested it on Unraid with plex as docker container running on Unraid. Work has been done to improve Windows interoperability.
While I cannot  support every case, it's worth checking the GitHub issues to see if your specific case has already been discussed.
I will still try to help out, but please note that I make no promises in providing assistance for every scenario.
**It is highly advised to use the setup script.**
