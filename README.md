# PlexCache: DEVELOPMENT VERSION

This is WORK IN PROGRESS, it might work it might *not*, it might also ruin you library and kill the missing unicorn.

Use at your own risk, read the code: there might be no code.

I take no responsabilities. Use the stable/main branch if you don't want to deal with this.
